# Tic-Tac-Toe: My First Pygame Project

## Description
This is an implementation of the game "Tic-Tac-Toe" built using Python. It utilizes Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. I completed this project by following a three-part series of step by step instructional videos published on the YouTube channel [Coding With Russ](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithRuss).

## Functionality
The game is ideally meant to be played by two people taking turns with the same computer. Players make their move by clicking on one of the nine cells on the game board. Their marker is placed appropriately, and the next player can take their turn. When a player achieves three of their markers in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally), the game displays the winner and an option to play again.

In addition to the features included in the video tutorials, I decided to add functionality for the game to handle ties. If a game ends in a tie, the game will display "Tie Game!" and give an option to play again.
